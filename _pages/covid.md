This work is for an academic and research purpose and should not
constitute a decision making support. We used a model that is simple in
its structure and its assumptions. The results do not necessarily
reflect the reality. Its purpose is to illustrate how social structure
and age distribution might affect the dynamic and public health
consequences of an outbreak.\
\

## Introduction

*"assessing the effectiveness of interventions that specifically target
social networks, such as school closure [or lock-down], requires models
that explicitly account for such social structure"* (Prem *et al.*
2017).\
The objective of the present work was to investigate, in absence of any
intervention, how much country-specific age distribution and social
contact pattern affect the basic reproduction number ($R_{0}$) and the
expected spread of the COVID-19 disease. Using an age-structured SIR
model fed with age distribution data and contact matrices, we predicted
and mapped $R_{0}$ for 147 countries. We also present the dynamic of the
outbreak and age distribution of hospitalization, as predicted by the
model, for four selected countries.\
\
\

## Methods

#### The SIR model

We used an age-structured SIR model with 16 age classes (0-4; 5-9;
10-14; ... 75+). It allow to explicitly account for the social structure
of the studied population. \begin{align}
\frac{dS_{i}}{dt} = -\beta S_{i} \sum_{j} C_{ij} I_{j}/N_{i} 
\end{align} \begin{align}
\frac{dI_{i}}{dt} = \beta S_{i} \sum_{j} C_{ij} I_{j}/N_{i} - \gamma I_{i} 
\end{align} \begin{align}
\frac{dR_{i}}{dt} = \gamma I_{i} 
\end{align}\
*Where* $\beta$ is the probability of transmission on contact, $i$ and
$j$ are indices for age classes, $\gamma$ is the recovery rate. $C$ is
the contact matrix. $N_{j}$ is the population in age $j$.\
\
\

#### Data

Contact matrices for 152 countries were obtained from the work of
[Prem](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697) *et al.* (2017).\
Data of age structure were obtained from the *Health Nutrition and
Population* (HNP) database available on the World Bank
[website](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics).
Age stratified estimates of infection severity were taken from the
article of Verity *et al.* (2020).\

#### Model parameters

From an estimated $R_{0}$ of 2.5 for France ([ETE modelling team,
2020](http://alizon.ouvaton.org/Rapport1_R0_France.html#situation_post-confinement)),
we estimated parameter $\beta$ (probability of transmission on contact)
using the following equality (Towers *et al.* 2012): \begin{align}
\beta = \frac{R_{0}}{\gamma}\lambda  
\end{align} *Where* $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix
$M$ such as $M_{ij} = C_{ij}f_{i}/f{j}$ with $f_{i}$ and $f_{j}$ are
frequencies in the population of age classes $i$ and $j$, respectively.
Parameter $\gamma$ (recovery rate) was set to $\frac{1}{14}$
days$^{-1}$.\
\

#### Analyses

All analyses were performed using the software R. The script for the
model was adapted from
[here](http://sherrytowers.com/2012/12/11/sir-model-with-age-classes/)
to be used with more than 2 age classes.\
We calculated $R_{0}$ for countries having both contact matrix and age
structure data available using the value of $\beta$ calculated with
France data (see *Model Parameter paragraph*). Predicted $R_{0}$ for 147
countries were mapped using additional R packages sf and plotly.\
We simulated the dynamic of the outbreak (prevalence of infection and
prevalence of immunization in the population) for 4 selected countries:
France, Germany, China and Niger. For this task, we introduced in the
model an infected individual in the 40-44 age group.\
We used age stratified proportion of severe infections to predict the
age distribution of severe cases.\
Data and codes are available online at
[GitHub](https://github.com/Nmoiroux/COVID).\
\

## Results

#### Predicting and mapping $R_{0}$ worldwide

Probability $\beta$ of transmission on contact based on an estimated
$R_{0}$ of 2.5 in France was estimated to be 0.0254205. Using this value
of $\beta$, we were able to predict $R_{0}$ in 147 countries (Figure
[1](#Fig1)) for which both contact matrices and age structure data were
available.\

##### *Figure 1: Map of predicted* $R_{0}$ for 147 countries in absence of intervention according to an age-structured SIR model.

*Countries differ only for age distribution of their population and for
social contact patterns. Other parameters (*$\beta$ and $\gamma$) being
equals.**These** $R_{0}$ values are prediction of a model, they are not
real data\
\

Predicted $R_{0}$ ranged from 1.52 in Germany
to 5.65 in Niger. Higher values of $R_{0}$
were found to be in the inter-tropical region.\
\

#### Age distribution and contact characteristics of four selected countries

We selected four countries: Niger (highest predicted $R_{0}$), France,
China and Germany (lowest predicted $R_{0}$). Age distribution and
contact matrix for each of these countries are presented in Figure
[2](#Fig2).\

##### *Figure 2: Age distribution, daily number of contacts and contact matrices for Niger (A, E, I), France (B, F, J), China (C, G, K) and Germany (D, H, L).*

*Horizontal red dashed lines indicate the mean number of daily contacts
per individuals. For contact matrix plots, darker color intensities
indicate more contacts. Data from
[here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005697) and
[here](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics).*\
\
\
Age distribution of Niger is typical of countries with high birth rate
and low life expectancy, the size of each cohort is larger than that of
older cohorts. In average, individuals in Niger experience
24 c.d$^{-1}$ (contacts per days). These
contacts occur mostly between individuals of \< 20 years old (that
represent more than 60% of the total population).\
Age distribution of France is almost stationary with a somewhat equal
proportion of the population in each age group. The mean number of daily
contact is 11.8 c.d$^{-1}$ mostly with individual
of the same age. There is little differences of daily number of contacts
among age classes.\
Age distributions of China and Germany are constrictive with lower
percentage of younger people. The mean number of daily contact in China
was 14 c.d$^{-1}$, closed to what is observed
in France but with more differences between age classes. Individuals in
Germany experience the lowest number of daily contact with a mean of
6.9 c.d$^{-1}$.\
\
\

#### Outbreak simulation for Niger, France, China and Germany

We then simulated the outbreak in these four countries (Niger, France,
China and Germany) using the SIR model. Predicted $R_{0}$ for these
countries were as follow:


```
## Niger R0 = 5.649338 
## France R0 = 2.499001 
## China R0 = 2.978447 
## Germany R0 = 1.514464
```

*Reminder:* $R_{0}$ of France was not predicted but estimated
[here](http://alizon.ouvaton.org/Rapport1_R0_France.html#situation_post-confinement)
and we used this value to estimate probability $\beta$ of transmission
on contact that was used, in turn, to estimate $R_{0}$ of other
countries (see Methods section).\
\

Here, we see that the higher is the mean number of contact per
individuals, the higher is $R_{0}$. Higher $R_{0}$ is expected to induce
faster outbreaks and a higher proportion of infected (and then
immunized) individuals (Figure [3](#Fig3) and [4](#Fig4)).\

#### Total severe cases and their distribution by ages

We used estimates of infection severity (*i.e.* needing hospitalization)
provided by Verity *et al.* (2020) to predict overall proportions of the
population expected to need hospitalization due to Covid-19 and its age
distribution ([Figure 5](#Fig5)).

The proportions of the population that were expected to need an
hospitalization were 1.3 %,
4.2 %,
3.8 % and
2.3 % in Niger,
France, China and Germany, respectively.\

##### *Figure 5: Expected age distribution of severe cases during an uncontrolled Covid19 outbreak for Niger (A), France (B), China (C) and Germany (D).*

\
\
Despite a higher proportion of the population expected to be infected,
Niger was predicted to experience the lower number (in proportion) of
severe case among the four studied countries. However, the median age
for severe cases is expected to fall in the 40-50 age group whereas it
is expected to be in the 50-60 age group for Germany and China. In
France, the median age for severe cases is expected to fall in the 60-70
age group.\
